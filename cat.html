        <h1>cat</h1> 
	<p>
	The command line offers many different powerful tools to
	manipulate files. One of the most useful ones is cat. This
	command allows you to print output to the screen in the
	terminal and concatonate files. Suppose we have two files,
	file1.txt and file2.txt. In the first file, we have the
	letters a-m listed in alphabetical order on each line, and in
	the second file, we have n-z.
	<br>
	Let's take a look and see how this works.</p>
        <div class ="Boxes" id="Box1">
	  <p>This is what happens when we cat file1.txt:</p>
	<div id = "cat1"><IMG SRC="blank_catfile1.png" ALT="some text"></div><br>
	  <p>And now let's look at file2.txt:</p>
        <div id = "cat2"><IMG SRC="blank_cat2.png" ALT="some text" ></div><br>
	  <p>You can also cat two files together. Unlike string
	  concatonation in python, the output is actually file1.txt
	  and file2.txt vertically stacked.</p>
	<div id = "cat12"><IMG SRC="blank_catfile1file2.png" ALT="some text" ></div><br>
	<p>We can also take the output of the "cat file1.txt
	file2.txt" command and save them to another file using the >
	symbol. In this example, we send the output of file1.txt and
	file2.txt to file3.txt. As long as nothing goes wrong, cat
	file1.txt file2.txt > file3.txt will not display any
	output. To see the results, we show cat file3.txt </p>
	<div id = "cat123"><IMG SRC="blank_catfile1file2file3.png" ALT="some text" ></div><br>

	<p>There is a way to concatonate two files together the way
	that string concatonation works in python. This command is
	called paste. It will output the two files horizontally, with
	the sets of input separated by tabs.</p>
	<div id = "paste12"><IMG SRC="blank_pastefile1file2.png" ALT="some text" ></div><br>

</div>
